        <p>Hello, my name is Landon Edwards and I'm from Hampstead, North Carolina. I enjoy playing basketball, video games, and going to the beach. I don't know a lot about software development or coding right now, but I think it is very interesting. I hope that this course helps me figure out if this is the right career path for me.</p>
