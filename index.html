            <p>Hello, my name is Landon Edwards and I'm from Hampstead, North Carolina. I enjoy playing basketball, piano, video games, and going to the beach. Though my culinary skills have a long way to go, I really like cooking new recipes I find online. I don't know a lot about software development or coding right now, but I think it is very interesting. For better or worse, technology has been present in most aspects of my life. I almost struggle to think of a time when I didn't have access to it in some form. It is for this reason that I now have a fervent desire to increase my understanding of how computers work, both physically and electronically. Additionally, I know that many software engineering and related positions can be done remotely; remote work is rather appealing to me as it would likely allow me to dedicate more time to my future family and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I hope that this course helps me figure out if this is the right career path for me.</p>

            <p>North Carolina is located in the eastern United States, bordering South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. It boasts beautiful scenery and warm summers. Its residents have access to beaches and mountains as well as many natural landmarks. Recently, the state's population has been on the rise due to lower costs and a more moderate climate.</p>
